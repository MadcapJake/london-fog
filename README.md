# london-fog package

London Fog takes operators in Earl Grey and turns them into lovely unicode.  London Fog tries to stay close to the original operator so as to not cause any cognitive dissonance.  There are some really silly logic operators though too!

## Things to do
- Add settings to toggle individual replacements
- Actually remove replacements when you toggle london-fog
- Allow custom replacements?
- Get it to work immediately on scroll
- Get it to work immediately upon entering tab
- Finish a good example and add as a gif
- Review any feedback and adjust unicode accordingly!

I'm especially interested in additions to the list of operators to conceal! :smile:
